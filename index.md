                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>I am Giridharan Sankar, a final year BS-MS student in the <a href="https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/physics">Department of Physics</a>, at the <a href="https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune</a>. I am interested in astrophysics; in particular, exoplanetary atmospheres and star formation theory. I am currently doing my masters' thesis on protostellar outflows at the <a href="https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/">Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA)</a>.</p>

            <p>Thanks to this little switch from studying the atmospheres of exoplanets to working on understanding nascent stages of stars, I have come to appreciate the complex interplay between physics, mathematics and chemistry, especially in the context of modelling outflows and circumstellar disk evolution, on top of my admiration for climate science garnered through my projects in the past couple of years. In a field like astronomy, where we have to rely mostly on observations (as opposed to repeatable experiments, which are fairly common in many fields of science), gaining a deep understanding of the models and their parameter spaces is imperative. It is also the reason why I am excited about this field, as new observations with better instruments have a tendency to chip away at the seemingly well crystallized theories of astronomy.</p>
            <p>My current focus is on studying the molecular outflows and the jet of the Class I/II young stellar object (YSO) DG Tau B, located ~140 pc away. Modelling out the morphology of these structures is by no means straightforward, as it has origins in magnetic fields threading through dust in a fairly complicated fashion, creating fast moving winds that spiral out of the protostar. We are planning to study the system by considering emissions of different species, such as H<sub>2</sub>, CO etc., These species emit photons at different frequencies depending on the transitions we are interested in, and trace out different parts of the system, at different temperatures, so on and so forth.</p>
            <p>On my spare time, I like to read novels and watch films (you can find my letterboxd <a href="https://letterboxd.com/senku02/">here</a>), and sometimes even write about them; you might hear me raving about The Banshees of Inisherin or Sorry to Bother You, time-to-time (both of which I highly recommend). I also enjoy listening to various genres of music; some of my favorite artists would be(including, not limited to) Radiohead, The Strokes, MF DOOM, Deftones and Black Country, New Road.</p>
