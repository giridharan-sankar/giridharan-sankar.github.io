## Research Projects

### Master's Thesis
- Researching outflows and jets of young stellar objects (YSOs) using ALMA and JWST datacubes.
- Aim: To identify jet-outflow morphologies and study systems using a unified outflow-jet bubble model.

### Protostellar Jets and Outflows
- Investigated molecular CO outflow morphology of DG Tau B under Dr. Hsien Shang's group at ASIAA, Taipei.
- Utilized ALMA data and tools like CARTA and Tomviz for visualization and analysis.

### Radiative Transfer Interface for Climate Models
- Worked with Dr. Joy Merwin Monteiro at IISER Pune to interface the radiative transfer code SOCRATES-RF with Python-based modeling toolkit climt.
- Learned Fortran90, Python, and C++ for project implementation.

### Exoplanetary Atmospheres
- Conducted atmospheric retrieval studies for WASP-39b using petitRADTRANS with synthetic JWST NIRSpec data, under Dr. Jayesh Goyal at NISER Bhubaneshwar.
