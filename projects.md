            <strong>Protostellar outflows:</strong> Worked with Dr. Hsien Shang's group from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei. My objective was to understand the morphology of the molecular CO outflow of the young stellar object (YSO) DG Tau B, by generating channel maps, integrated intensity maps, etc. Also became comfortable with image cubes and the image cube processing tool CARTA.

            <strong>Radiative Transfer Interface:</strong> Worked with Dr. Joy Monteiro from IISER Pune to create a working interface between the Fortran90 based radiative transfer code SOCRATES-RF and the Python based climate modeling toolkit CLiMT. I was able to make the interface work for simple scenarios, and my colleague is currently working on expanding the interface to include clouds and make the models work for other exoplanets as well.

            <strong>Understanding exoplanetary atmospheres:</strong> With Dr. Jayesh Goyal, NISER Bhubaneshwar, I worked to understand the idea behind transmission spectroscopy used in detecting exoplanets and the idea of inverse theory and parameter estimation employed to find the atmospheric characteristics of the planet under consideration.
